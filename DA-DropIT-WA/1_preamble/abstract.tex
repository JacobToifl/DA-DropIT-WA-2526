\section{Abstract}

DropIT is a user-friendly document management system developed to make it easier to store, organize, and find digital files. The system works together with Microsoft services such as SharePoint and Entra ID, allowing secure login and central storage of documents.
With AI-supported classification and metadata extraction, DropIT can automatically recognize document types and important information like contract periods or expiration dates. Features such as full-text search, filters, and a built-in reminder system help users manage documents faster and more efficiently.
This thesis describes the idea, design, development, and evaluation of the system. The goal of DropIT is to offer a clear, reliable, and scalable solution that improves document handling for both private users and organizations.
